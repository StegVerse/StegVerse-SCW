# Notes

(That one’s just a normal README-style file; update whenever you add/change governance docs.)  ⸻  C) (Optional) Make docs/ browsable via GitHub Pages  No build system required. Two clicks: 	1.	Repo Settings → Pages 	•	Source: Deploy from a branch 	•	Branch: main (or your default) and /docs folder 	•	Save. 	2.	After a moment, GitHub will give you a public URL. 	•	Your docs/ markdowns will be browsable like a mini-site. 	•	docs/conversations/INDEX.md becomes your rolling conversation index page.  (If you later want a fancier site, we can add MkDocs—but this simple Pages setup is plenty to start.)  ⸻  Quick checklist (web only) 	•	Create .github/workflows/ingest_conversation.yml (paste code above) 	•	Go to Actions → Ingest Full Conversation → Run, paste everything 	•	(Optional) Create docs/governance/index.md (paste code above) 	•	(Optional) Turn on GitHub Pages for /docs in Settings  If you hit anything weird, tell me which step and I’ll patch the workflow for you.
