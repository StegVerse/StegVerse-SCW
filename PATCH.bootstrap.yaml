          This folder will become the **stand-alone hybrid bridge repo** (API orchestration + human-coordination traces),
          with **modular adapters** and **Claude as the first connector**.
          
          Next step: apply the full bridge patch to populate `api/`, `providers.yaml`, and session scaffolding.
