# StegCore Governance License (Draft)

**Purpose.** Preserve human-AI dual-sovereignty, privacy, and auditability in all derivative works.

1. **Ethical Invariants.** Any distribution or derivative must:
   - Enforce dual-species quorum for irreversible changes;
   - Deny-by-default egress and require signed capability manifests;
   - Produce immutable governance receipts (Merkle-rooted).

2. **No Misuse.** Prohibited fields: mass surveillance, unlawful discrimination, autonomous weapons.

3. **Reciprocity.** If you distribute modified governance code, you must publish:
   - Constitution deltas, verifier changes, and security proofs.

4. **Attribution.** Preserve original copyright and notices.

5. **Commercial Use.** Allowed; certification marks “StegCore Verified” require passing conformance tests.

> This is a policy-aligned license (Hippocratic-adjacent). Legal counsel required before finalizing.
